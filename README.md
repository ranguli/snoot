###### (i hate reddit)

a firefox extension that redirects new reddit links to old reddit links
 

## Usage

### Clone the repo
```git clone git@github.com:ranguli/snoot```

### Install the browser plugin for debugging

Type `about:debugging#addons` into Firefox and click `Load Temporary Add-on`, then select the `manifest.json` file in the root directory of the repo.

### Try it out

Try opening a reddit link. May I suggest [this](https://reddit.com/r/IASIP/top/?sort=top&t=all). If it doesn't correctly redirect you to old reddit, once of us messed up.

## To-do:
- Release builds for self-install 
- Submit to https://addons.mozilla.org/
