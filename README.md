## Usage

### Download from Mozilla

You can get Snoot on the Mozilla marketplace at [addons.mozzila.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/snoot/)!

### Build and install locally (for local development)

```
git clone git@github.com:ranguli/snoot
npm install
```

Install the plugin as a temporary addon in your browser, then:

```
web-ext run
```

### Try it out

Try opening a reddit link. May I suggest [this](https://reddit.com/r/IASIP/top/?sort=top&t=all). If it doesn't correctly redirect you to old reddit, once of us messed up.
