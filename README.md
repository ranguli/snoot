###### (i hate reddit)

a firefox extension that redirects new reddit links to old reddit links


## Usage


## Development

### Running the plugin for debugging

First clone the repo

```git clone git@github.com:ranguli/snoot```

Install dependencies

```npm install```

Build and run the extension

```web-ext run```

### Try it out

Try opening a reddit link. May I suggest [this](https://reddit.com/r/IASIP/top/?sort=top&t=all). If it doesn't correctly redirect you to old reddit, once of us messed up.

## To-do:
- Release builds for self-install
- Submit to https://addons.mozilla.org/
- Dark mode theme with toggle option
- Extension enable/disable button
